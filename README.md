# The Auto Machine Learning Algorithm Comparison App
A web app to perform multiple machine learning alogortihms on user uploaded file.

The app can be visited at https://auto-ml-compare-app.herokuapp.com/

# About the App
This app is able to provide detailed comparison of multiple machine learning models on user uploaded file using **lazypredict** library. Bouston house dataset is used for illustration. Wine quality dataset has also been provided in the app.

The App includes:
- Overview of Dataset
- Option to upload your own dataset
- Sliders of changing the set parameters:
  - Data split ratio
  - Random seed number
- Detailed description of ML algorithm used
- Comparison criteria:
  - R-Square
  - RMSE
  - Calculation Time
- Option to download training, test files along with R2, RMSE and time taken plots
